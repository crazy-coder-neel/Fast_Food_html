<br>   
<h2 align="justify"><p><font color="green">
Fast food plays a large role in the diets of young people.
Fast food is the most unhealthy food product marketed to children, other than sugar-sweetened beverages, and is relentlessly and aggressively targeted 
toward them.
 Few fast food items meet healthy nutrition standards and there is concern about the impact of fast food consumption on young people's 
overall nutrition and health. Fast food companies spent more than $4.2 billion on marketing in 2010, which was more than any other food category,
 with the exception of carbonated beverages. The restaurants market their products to children extensively using the internet, social media,
 television, and in-store promotions.
