<h1 align="center"><b><font color="green"><span style="background-color:orange;">How did you objectively determine what makes a healthy fast food item?</span></font></b></h1>
<br>   
<h2 align="justify"><p><font color="white">
Central to this research is the evaluation of the nutrient content of thousands of menu items offered at 12 fast food restaurants in the United States. We reviewed the scientific literature on how to score foods for their nutrition and believe that the most scientifically-validated system is the nutrient profiling system used in the United Kingdom. This nutrition profiling system was developed by Rayner and colleagues at Oxford University and is used by government in the United Kingdom to determine which foods can be marketed to children on television.
market and sell healthier food for kids, only 3% of kids' meal combinations at the 12 restaurants in this analysis met these industry standards.  Although many restaurants offer a healthy option for the side and beverage in kids' meals, they are not the default items included at most restaurants and a healthy main dish is also not available at a number of chains.
